<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a passionate and motivated Electronics and Communication Engineering student currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree at RMK College of Engineering and Technology.
   With a strong academic foundation and a CGPA of 7.76 (up to the 5th semester),
   I am constantly exploring the intersection of hardware and software.
   My interest in IoT (Internet of Things), web development, and embedded systems has led me to take up relevant certifications,
   including NPTEL's Elite certification in IoT and Cloud Computing basics.</p>

<p>Alongside my academics, I actively participate in technical symposiums and paper presentations, 
  where I enjoy sharing my ideas and learning from others. 
  I have hands-on experience with programming languages like Python, Java, HTML, CSS, and I am currently expanding my skills in HTML,CSS and Java to become a more versatile developer.
  I am also keen on improving my communication and interview skills, 
  I regularly take part in mock interviews and placement preparations to stay confident and ready.</p>

<p>Adaptable, emotionally resilient, and determined, I believe in continuous growth and learning.
   Whether it's organizing events, solving coding challenges, or contributing to team projects, 
   I give my best with a positive mindset.
   My goal is to build smart, impactful solutions using technology and secure a fulfilling role in the tech industry 
   where I can grow both personally and professionally.</p>
